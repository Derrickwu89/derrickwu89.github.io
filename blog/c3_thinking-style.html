				<p>I took the Gregorc Thinking Style test during the pre-phase 0 work. At that time, I was more an abstract person that is more towards abstract sequential and abstract random. I think that is kind of accurate. I like to learn from reading references and expert sources as well as working with other people, sharing things I know and learn things that they know and I don’t know. </p>

				<p>Now it has been the third week of Phase 0, I had learned a lot in these challenges and works. I found that when I do the work myself, it is kind of difficult. I think that is because I don’t know whether I did it correctly or I made any mistake on those challenges. That is my biggest struggle. My struggle would be my free time is not as flexible as other people, so I found that is harder for me to find someone that is able to work with me on the challenge in a pair. In this unit-1, I had couple of pairing experiences. I found that working with other people really help you a lot. They can teach you things that you don’t know and working with things that you have struggled with.  </p>

				<p> What would be my biggest struggle right now? First, I think my learning style is not that good because by just reading and no one is explaining the material to me would be harder for me to understand the learning material. Secondly, my times is not that flexible as I mentioned before, so I need to find more time to learn about the material so I can get better at it. Right now, I think that I need to change some my learning strategy by doing more pair session even just half hour, I will still find more time to do that and watch more video on youtube. I need to do more practice as well.</p>
