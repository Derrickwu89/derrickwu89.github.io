				<p>I am just a beginner in Web development; I will try my best of explaining things I learn in this first week of challenge. Version control is a method of keeping track of any adjustment you make on a file. It tracks changes your made and the time you made the change. If you made any mistake or need to revise the previous version of your work, it will help you and allow you to do so. While version control allows you to keep track of your work, it also allows you to work on the same file with other people without interrupting other people. Version control can let you and your team working on the same project or file in different time different area and not affecting the other party’s file. You and your team can then merge those files together to generate a final project. Merging is taking two or more people’s work and combines them into a new complete document. There are many different type of version control system, and the most popular ones for developers are Subversion and Git.

Git is one of the most popular version control system. Git allows you to save many versions of the project or works as you continue to make changes in your files. As long as you install Git on your computer and create directory for your project, you can start saving versions of your work. When you wants to save your work, you can you add or commit function to save your work. Your work will always be saving in your local computer. You can update your work anytime you want and make it perfect until your merge your files with the repository file.

While Git is located in your computer, Github is on the internet which is opposite of Git. Github is a platform where you and your team can store your work or codes. The platform for is great for team work. When you and your team are working on any kind of programing project, you can set up a repository to store your work up at Github. When you and your team have Git install in the local computer you can push your work up to Github by using Git that you have been pre install in your local computer. When you push the work to Github, your team members will be able to see it on the internet. They will be either pull it to their computer and continue to work on it or merge their part of work to the file that is on the Github. Github is good for programing because developer might have a lot of different code and need to merge together so they would want to use Github to store their code.
