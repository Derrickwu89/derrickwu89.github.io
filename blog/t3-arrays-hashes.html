				 <h1>Array and Hash</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>11/16/2014</time>
				<p>This week’s technical blog, I will introduce Ruby arrays and hash. Ruby arrays are collection of any object that can be similar to each other. A hash is a collection of key value pairs with two related element. These two methods can be very similar yet different. </p>

				<p>Let’s talk about array first. Ruby arrays can hold element such as string, integer, object, or another array. Array always surrounded with []. There are several ways to can write an array. They are Array.[](elements), Array[elements], and x=[elements]. </p>

				<p>Let’s give an example, if you think you need to store some technology brand in an array, you can write it like: </p>
				<p>Tech_brand = [“Apple”, “IBM”, “Microsoft”, “Dell”]</p>
				<p>Now we can talk about hash. Hash is used to store elements in pair. So that mean you can store one element in related to another element. You can say that use one element to represent another element. An example of how hash expressed is:</p>
				<p>Months  = {“January” => “1”, “February” => “2”, “March” => “3”}</p>
				<P>Since hashes assign one element to another, you don’t have to count the number in the array. You can directly find the element by entering what is assign to that element. </p>
