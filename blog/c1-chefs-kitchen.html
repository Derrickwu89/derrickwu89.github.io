				<p>It’s a risk. When I first heard about this program from my cousin, I thought this program was so risky. What I meant risky is not about the scam, but it’s about how many things that I need to sacrifice in learn this program. Is it worth it for me to take the risk of losing my jobs, losing all the time I can spend with my family and friend, and lastly the money? I don’t want to take the risk and decide not to apply for this program few months ago. 

Things changed. About a month ago, I hear my cousin talks about this program again. I listened and did some research on this program. I never thought this program will be any different from other school or tutor programs. However, when I start apply and find out more detail and curriculum about this program, I started to change the impression of this program. I found out that this program is not just about learning how to code, but something more. I found that people in this Bootcamp is very friend, gave me a warm feeling that I would want to enjoy my time in this program even though I never experience anything yet. I want to try out this program. I think this program can change not only my skill but also my way of thinking things and way of seeing my life in a different perspective.

After listen to Shereef’s concept of learning and going to this program, I think his concept is really important to learn something new. In order to learn effectively, I think the learner must be happy and enjoy the things that he or she needs to learn. If he or she is not enjoy the process of learning, there is no way that he or she will get the materials in their brain or use them effectively. 
I’m excited, but yet also very nervous about this program. I have a shy characteristic inside of me. I’m not an outgoing person. That worried me of how can I be comfortable in this program. I’m afraid that I cannot communicate with other people, not enough knowledge to keep up the challenge and other works. I worry a lot of stuff. I hope that this program can change my way of living and my life.
