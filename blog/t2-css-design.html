				 <h1>Inline Vs. Block</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>11/9/2014</time>
				<p>Most of the HTML elements are displayed in two ways. The first one is Block and second one is Inline. The block takes up the full line or full width of the page that is available. The Inline takes up only much the width as it needs and it will not create new line itself unless necessary. 
Common HTML elements are naturally displays in a block form are: "div", "h1..h6", "p", "ul", "ol" "table" and etc. Some inline example would be "span", "a", "strong", "em", "br", "img" and etc. Although these elements have their natural display form, they still can be change and override by giving additional command of property and value. </p>
<p>Since we know that a block form is taking the entire row or width of the page that is available. We can override and limited the width of these blocks by giving number pixels of width that the block can have. The other way to change the block is to give a command to display these blocks into a inline form so they will list themselves in a horizontal line. </p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of display in blocks and inline. If you have block-level element, you can adjust the margin to the way you like, and it will be placed below the previous elements in the mark up. It does not require giving a width, since the width is 100%. Inline element will flow along with the text content. It is subject to vertical-align property. At the end we can say that the block is an structural elements, while the inline element are text-based. </p>
