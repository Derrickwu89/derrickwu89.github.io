				 <h1>Class and</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>12/7/2014</time>
				<p>On the other post of my blog we talked about the class and basic formation of it. This time we will talk about the different between the class and modules. We can use the other blog's example again in this blog.  </p>
				<p>Last week's class example is the following.</p>
				<p>class business</p>
				<p>end</p>
				<p>finance.business.new</p>
				<p>In this case, we just make a business called finance and we can use the any class method in the new finance class that we just created. We can set up some finance related method in this class, so in the future we can call use those methods by just calling finance.method. </p>
				<p>A module is a collection of behaviors that is usedable in other classes through a mixins. The key word for mixin is include. We can created some method can be use in more than one class.</p>
				<p>For example,</p>
				<p>module sales</p>
				<p>   def sales</p>
				<p>      puts talk to customer</p>
				<p>   end</p>
				<p>end</p>
				<p>class business</p>
				<p>include sales</p>
				<p>end</p>
				<p>finance.business.new</p>
				<p>finance.sales</p>
				<p>Now we enter the modules. Every class from now on can just type in "include sales", they will now have the access to the method. The method will described anything. It is not an object. It can be said that it is a characteristic for more than one objects. </p>
