				 <h1>Values</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>12/14/2014</time>
				<p>After reading all the vocabularies that try to make that apply to me, I would choose Economic security, Helping others and Affection as the words that fits me the most. In general, I tried to lived up to those values that I choose at the best of I can. I choose those words because they are more realistic in to everyone’s life. </p>

				<p>First I chose Economic security as the primary value to me. That is because without a good economic security, there is nothing else that we can achieve. In order for us or our life to do better to do more or enjoy more of our life, we need to have money to at least earn enough for us to spend. If that cannot be achieves, I don’t think anything else matter. The second thing that I chose is to help others. I chose this is because helping other people will make me happy and want share my strength and joy with other people. When you pass by a homeless man, you have more than enough for you to eat, why not share some with the homeless, so they can be happy and stuffed too. The third value that I wrote is affection. I want to help more people, and I want other people to do the same too, everyone shares the love and joy with other people. I think in order to achieve that, we needs affection. Everyone needs to pass on the love and affection so other people will follow what you are doing.  </p>

				<p>What was last topic that that someone asks my advices on? If it does not include programming, I would say financial advice, since that is the field that I am working right now, so I do help other understand the situation of their portfolio and make sure they can manage and understand their portfolio themselves. If we are talking about programming, I don’t think anyone has asked me to give some advice yet, since I’m not an expert yet. </p>
				
				<p>I felt great about those values right now, I want to learn more things, do better in my work and study, so I can accomplish those values in my mind step by step. These values definitely mediate stereotype threats. I want to have those values in my heart, so I would want to tackle all the stereotype threat so they won’t bother my life. </p>
