				 <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>11/30/2014</time>
				<p>In DBC, pair session is really important. I like to pair with other people in doing the challenges, and I like to learn from other people in the pair session. After the pair session we also need to rate our partners and give them feed back in order to help them do better in the next pairing session. This is a brand new experience for me. I never experience in pair with other people in different subject, because it would be really difficult because one person would do all the work and other will be listening. That is not a good way of pairing.
</p>

				<p>This is the 6 week of DBC phase 0, I had been doing pairing session with other people. I like it. I don’t have too much of the programming experience as other people has, so I have to learn from the partner. That does not mean that my partner is doing all the work. We split into drive and navigator. However, when we come to conflict we discuss what would be the best way to solve the problem. Pairing session is fund and rewarding when we finally come up with the answer that runs without any error. When we run into conflict, first we tried to Google it and see if we can find any research useful, if we are not able to do so, we would take a break and come back to the problem when we have clear mind. 
</p>

				<p>We give feedback to our partners after the pairing session. I looked into them and see if there anything that I can be improve. I think the most important thing that I need to improve is my programming knowledge. I feel nerves when I read my feedback, because I’m not sure if other people will think that I am a lagger or not. If there are some thing that I need to learn and improve when ti mention on the feedback, I would definitely do it. Base on the feedback I received, I think that I need to improve on explaining and make it more detail so my partner would understand what I’m talking about. </p>
				<p>I write my feed back the way how I feel about my partner and their knowledge on the topic. I always learn from my partner so I never had experience in bad partners. The most difficult to write a feedback for your partner is how long would you want to write the feedback.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I think that in programming, pairing session is really helpful for you to learn things that you don’t understand. I would love to pair more if I have the time so that I would improve fast and to be better in programming. </p>
