				 <h1>Stereotype threat</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>11/30/2014</time>
				<p>Stereotype threats are serious issue in term of working, study, or social enviornment. Some people may have experience a lot of stereotype threat from different ways and times. I think the main purpose of the stereotype threat is trying to create some sort of disadvantage to other party. The original party may feel that they are not as good or skilled as other party so they need to create some harassment to other party in order to gain back their territory or position. Original party may also issue stereotype threats because they have issue and hatred on the other party which has done nothing wrong.</p>

				<p>For me personally, I never had experience in any kind of stereotype threat so far in my school life or career. I definitely would not be able to understand how it would make me feel or how would it affect my performance. The only time that I had ever experience and still kept in my heart is that when my teacher questioned my performance in a city wide examination. I remember that I had achieved a high score in that exam, and my teacher questioned how did I achieved that score. I did not have any bad feelings about it, but just make me upset a bit. The only reason that I could have thought of is that they do not believed a new immigrant can achieved a high score in an city wide English and Math examination. </p>

				<p>I never felt how stereotype threat feels so I would not have a clear answer for how I feel about some of other groups of people that is experiencing in stereotype threating.  I think the only way that you can ever fight for the stereotype threat is to do better under a disadvantage position to show other people that they can do it and not afraid of any threats. Until the time that the original group finally admits that they failure to suppress the other group of people, they will stop the threating and start to change and enhance the equality in working, studying and other environment. That is just my thought, there always other ways to help the suppress group, but I would not give much of advice, because I never experience one. </p>
