				 <h1>Tech - Computer Memory</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>12/21/2014</time>
				<p> This week we are talking about computer memory, which is the internal storage areas in the computer. Memory refers to the physical devices or chips that store programs and date for temorary or permanent basis. Every computer comes with some amount of physical memory, usually that is call main memory or RAM. RAM stands for (random-access memory). It can read and write data and programs. </p>
				<p>There are other types of memory in the computer besides RAM or main memory. The most common memory that we know is ROM (read-only memory). Computers almost always contain a small amount of read-only memory that holds instructions for starting up the comput. It is different from RAM, because it can only be read and can not change or overwrite the data or program that it current has for read only. </p>
				<p>There are other memories type besides ROM and RAM those were commonly known for. There PROM which is programmable read-only memory. You can store a program in PROM, but once it was used, it cannot be wipe clean or use it to store something else. That is also known for non-volatile memoery just like the ROM. EPROM is also know as erasable programming read-only memory that is just liek PROM but can be erased only under exposing it to ultraviolet light. EEPROM is electricall erasable programmable read-only memory that can erase date and programs only exposing it to an electrical charges.</p>
				<p>There are many more memories out there for we to cover, but generally speaking, these are the main ones that all computers would likely to be use. We need to remember all programs that we create will have bytes and they will all be store in the memory of the disk or chip and any phyical way.</P>
