				 <h1>Questions</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>1/11/2015</time>
				<p> This week we need to learn how to ask a good question. So far in this long preparation time, there are many questions that I want to ask. However, I'm not sure how I need to ask qustions so I usually wouold just look up some key term in Google, and hopefully that will guide me to the answer or similar concept that I would want to know. </p>
				<p> Generally, when I look up other people's question, good question will provide key terms and how they don't understand. When other people answer those good question, they would have an idea of what need to be answer. Bad question might not have good key term or good idea of what they want to ask.</p>
				<p>I definitely will keep question idea in mind, when I get on site and if I don't understand anything, I will be sure that I have key term and good concept of what I don't understand so I can ask better questions. </p>
