				<p>There are always issue with any kind of industry. Financial, Health, Tech, Science iudustry, they all have issues within them. The most obvious problem for tech or technology sections is demographic issue. Majority of the population that work in this industry is male and majority. There are very little women and minority that are getting into this sector.</p>
				<p>There are always theory that women don't like computer stuff, they think that is too geeky and only boys or guys will like that. There are other theory states that male is the one that love the computer or technology more than girls. It does not matter which thoery is true and which theory is wrong, the fact is that many women and minority that just can't get into this field, because they are dominated by white, asian people and men. </p>
				<p>I think that in order to solve this problem, technology sector should create more opportunity for these minority. We should enhance their knowledge and allow them to have the same education opportunity as other people have. Give them more opportunity will help more women and minority understand what this field is about and help them get into a field that they never thought they have the opprotunity to get into.</p>
