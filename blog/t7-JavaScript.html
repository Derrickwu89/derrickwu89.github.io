				 <h1>JavaScript</h1>

				<p>This week, I have learned some basic JavaScript. After some reading and coding with JavaScript, I found that it has many similarities with Ruby. For example, Ruby’s Hashes and JavaScript’s Objects are similar, Ruby classes and JavaScript’s functions are similar, and Ruby’s Looping  and JavaScript’s looping are similar. Although, these subjects are very similar between ruby and JavaScript, since their syntax are different, the way they interpret are different as well. </p>
				<p>For Ruby, we assign key and values in the hashes, each key in ruby must be unique and cannot be duplicate. JavaScript’s objects are also similar to that. JavaScript’s object can set up property and make the property has some value in it. For example, ruby hash looks like this </p>
				<p>Grades = {“Jane Doe” => 10, “Jim Doe” => 6}</p>
				<p>While JavaScript would look like this:</p>
				<p>Grade= {</p>
				<p>        JaneDoe: 10,</p>
				<p>        JimDoe: 6,</p>
				<p>}</p>
				<p>Ruby hashes and JavaScript’s Objects has similar function and similar usage, but yet they are so different. Their syntaxes are just different and so are their looks. Although they both use curly braces, ruby would separate the key and value by using the arrow sign, JavaScript would separate the property and the value with the colon.</p>
