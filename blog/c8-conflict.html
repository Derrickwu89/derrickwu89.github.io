				 <h1>Conflict</h1>
				<time datetime ="date"/>12/21/2014</time>
				<p> This week We are talking about conflict. Internal conflict, external conflict or any conflict that we experience in our life and how to solve conflict. </p>
				<p>1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflect with someone. What was it about? What happened? I had emotional conflict with someone that I like before. We usually to be very close and had some very good time. However, at one day, I found that she has some thing that betrays me and my believes. I found it very shocking, upset, angry and depressed. </p>
				<p>2. What was the source of the conflict? The source is not on me, is on that person. SHe was very indecisive and the source is nothing that I can be control of.</p>
				<p>3. How did you handle that conflict? I'm not sure if I had handle the situation and that conflict correctly. But I went to ask friend and family's opinion. It has not gonna any better though since is two people issues. </P>
				<p>4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse? I personally think that my action has make it worse because now there is a scars on both of us. I'm not sure how it will affect us in the future and whether it will be heal.</p>
				<p>5. If you could go back, whay would you do differently, if anything? If I could go back to the beginning, I'm not sure if I would do something that is different, but at least I would try to understand the situation before taking any actions. One thing for sure is that I don't want to leave any scars or regrets at the past so I would want to do whatever it takes to make it more decisive as much as possible. </p>
				<p> 6. What did you learn from this experience? I learn alot. Everything needs time to heal. Time will make everything clear. You cannot hide what things that happen. We need to face the reality and not to avoid them. Try to treasure what it's important to you and not to leave any thing regret. </p>
